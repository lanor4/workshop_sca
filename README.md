# Workshop SCA 

## Intro
This is the repo for the SCA "intro to website making" workshop. It includes a simple html/css resumÃ© project, and a guide.pdf file that explains things. 

## How to see the website ? 
Click on the big green "code" button on the top of this page. Then, click on "download zip", and finally, unzip the folder on your computer, and click on "index.html". If you see some code instead of a beautiful website, try to open it with your favorite web browser (e.g open with > google chrome). 

## How to see the code ? 
Instead of "open with > web browser", open index.html or style.css with your favorite text editor. If you don't have any, just open it with notepad or something similar. You'll then see the code that'll be explained during the workshop. 

## I don't understand anything in the code ... 
And that's OK. The guide.pdf provides an introduction to the main concepts/ideas of html and web dev in general.
